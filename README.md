# Python Assingment

## This repository includes: 
* BCB 546X_Python HW_Perea-Lopez.ipynb: Jupyter notebook documenting the script needed to complete the code provided in "sequence_translate.py" and documentation needed to understand the code
* align_seqs.fasta: from the BONUS, .fasta file of the multiple aligned sequences from "penguins_cytb.fasta"
* penguins_cytb.fasta: .fasta file containing cytochrome-b sequences from penguins
* penguins_mass.csv: .csv file containing containing mass of penguin species
* penguins_mass_cytb.csv: .csv file of "penguins_mass" DataFrame with GC content and molecular weight for each penguin species
* sequence_translate.py: instructions for this assignment 
* visualization.png: .png of the "Mass of Penguin Species" bar plot, as Git is unable to preview the barplot in the .ipynb file due to visualization using Vega; when code is run in Jupyter, the code does output the bar plot
